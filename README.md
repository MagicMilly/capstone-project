# The Bechdel Test & Women in Film
### Capstone Project for Flatiron Data Science Program

## Motivation
The Bechdel Test is a scoring system used to measure how a film and other forms of media represent women. The Bechdel Test [website](https://bechdeltest.com/) contains over 8,000 user-submitted films and their scoring on the test. Users can also challenge a film's score if they believe it was rated incorrectly. Points are awarded as follows:
* 1 point for two named female characters 
* 2 points for two named female characters who talk to each other
* 3 points for two named female characters who talk to each other about something other than a man

At first glance, this test may seem easy to pass, but a surprising number of popular and award-winning films do not pass the test - even films with strong female leads. **The Edge of Tomorrow** starring Emily Blunt as a badass, alien-slaughtering warrior, for example, scores one sad point on the test because there is only one other named female character in the movie, and she never speaks to Blunt's character.
